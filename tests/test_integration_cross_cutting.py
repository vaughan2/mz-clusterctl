"""
Cross-cutting integration tests for mz-clusterctl.

These tests cover functionality that spans multiple strategies or tests
system-wide behavior like error handling, dry-run mode, and cluster filtering.

These tests use the tool the way a user would:
1. Set up clusters and strategy configurations in a real Materialize database
2. Run the CLI tool using 'uv run mz-clusterctl apply'
3. Verify that the expected changes were applied to the database

These tests require a real Materialize instance and test the full workflow.
